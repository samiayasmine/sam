		<th class="headings" colspan="3"> Netflix's Green Eggs And Ham </th>
			<td>
			In recent years, Netflix has been expanding their content from feature films are network televsion contracts to independently produced television sows, documentaries and movies of their own. In the process, they have managed to strike licensing deals with major companies, like Marvel, Dc, and now Warner Bros. With this expansion, they have chosen to take the beloved childhood classic 'Green Eggs And Ham' by Dr.Seuss and adapt it to a silver screen (or whatever you'd call televsion streaming on computer screens). With the help of Ellen Degeneres and some major executive producers in Hollywood, they solidified a release date for the series in 2015.

		<th class="headings" colspan="3"> Paula Deen's Green Eggs And Ham Receipe </th>
			<td>
				Prior to her prejudical revelations, Paula Deen was the premier Southern Belle on the Food Network. Her dedication to creating food that tastes good even if it's not good for you made her a beloved Food Network chef. For anyone who's ever wondered what green eggs and ham tastes like, I'm sure you imagined (Just as I have) that it has some unique flavor or texture to it. However, in Paula Deen's rendition, it contains only 6 ingredients, the key ingredient being none other than green food coloring. Now, if that doesn't scream child-like wonder, then I don't know what does.

			<td>
				After the success of "The Cat in the Hat", (which only used 225 different words) Seuss' editor challenged him to use even fewer. And so, Green Eggs and Ham was born. With just 50 different words used to make the entire story, I think it's safe to say Seuss won the bet. Since it's 1960 publication, it has become a staple on every child's bedroom bookshelf. Who knew a gentleman's wager could change the world?
